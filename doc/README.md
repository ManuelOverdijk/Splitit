# Android: Student's Choice Assignment

## App Proposal

The main purpose of the app is to give users the ability to split a bill in seperate payments among their friends. 
Users can create a chatroom where they can chat and add bills to be paid by all the group members. Anyone in the group can add bills and invite other friends by either email or username. 

The main view of the app consits of a list of all the chats the users is currently active in. When clicking on a list item, the user is represented three swipable views, consiting of an overview of all the active bills, one view where users can chat with eachother, and another view with the group information.

The App has basic chat functionality, where users can partake in a chatroom and chat with eachother. 
In the Bill view, users see an overview of all active bills. At the top of the view users can create a new Bill. The history of the inactive/complete bills is represented at the bottom of the screen.
The Info view lists the basic group information, like name and active participants.

### The creator of a bill can:
	1. change the bills name
	2. Add a photo
	4. Set the total amount to be paid
	5. Set the individual amount to be paid by a member
	6. Delete the bill
	7. Mark the bill as completed

Users can signup by using either Facebook, Google+ or create an account with their emailadres and chosen password. 

The App will use the new Material Design by Google.

### Screen mockup:

### API usage:	
	1. Google Play services
	2. Firebase Android Api, for database connectivity
	3. Facebook Login API
	4. Android Support Library v7, for material design 

### Future:
I would like to add PayPal and Ideal functionality for the payments but I oversee that is realistic in only six weeks.
